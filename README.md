##Models
We have an article model, which is comprised of a title and text.


##Controllers
"Receive specific requests for the application."
Take user input and call appropriate methods. 

##Views
Display output (comments, articles).

#Database Operations (CRUD)

##Create
The articles controller takes user input and calls methods to create and save a new article.

##Read
The articles controller lists all of our articles with an index method and displays them with a show method.
These are shown to users through views, which contain links to actions in controllers.
